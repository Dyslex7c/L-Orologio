A Reddit bot made using `PRAW` library that shows data about the various palindromes used by a single user in a tabular format.

The source of [u/DyFogliameBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/DyFogliameBot), it replies to the user concerned when summoned.

# Main Features
- Streams upto 1000 comments/replies of a user at a time
- Detects any word which fits into the definition of a palindrome - be it numeric or literal or even a symbol

### Using the bot:
- Navigate to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps and create an app as a script
- Set a valid redirect URL
- After creating the app, set your `client_id` and `client_secret` from the webpage. Set your `username` and `password` as well.
- Navigate to your bot directory and run `python main.py`

# Drawbacks
